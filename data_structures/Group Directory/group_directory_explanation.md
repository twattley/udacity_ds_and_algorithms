## Design:
A recursive algorithm is used for the file search as the input is unknown and a recursive structure will be suitable as this problem although about files is identical to tree traversal and it will simply traverse all parts of the tree


## Time Complexity
in terms of time complexity the time taken to excute depends on the number of directories so can be described as 0(sd * n) where sd equals sub directories

## Space Complexity
space complexity is order 0(n), the number of call frames put onto the stack linearly related to input
