Design:

this algorithm is set up by initialising the min and max variables with the first values they see and then moving through the list and updating them in place

Time Complexity:

O(n) linear time where n is the size of the list


Space Complexity:

0(n + min_var + max_var) the space taken up by the pointers to min and max will be minimal compared to the list size so this is o(n)
