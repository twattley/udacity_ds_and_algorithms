Design:

the square root function has been designed using binary search, the array between 0 and the input number is a naturally sorted array so it is a problem that lends itself to binary search 

Time complexity:

being binary search the problem will have a time complexity of 0(log n) as the input grows the time will grow but as the problem space is being halved every time it will grow but only logarithmically 

Space complexity:

space is 0(1) there will be one input integer this is to all intents and purposes constant space
