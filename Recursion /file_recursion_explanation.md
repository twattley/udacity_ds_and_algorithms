A recursive algorithm is used for the file search as the input is unknown and a recursive structure will be suitable as this problem although about files is identical to tree traversal and it will simply traverse all parts of the tree

the space and time complexity for the file recursion function is linear as it will grow with the size of the input files/folders specified orginally
