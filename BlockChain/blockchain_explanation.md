the blockchain has been implemented as a linked list, it has been chosen as the need to linked each part to the previous to form a chain via hashes is necessary and the ability to prepend in constant time with the size unknown makes this more suitable than a contiguous block of memory

time complexity is constant 0(1) new blocks are simply added to the front of the blockchain a python dictionary has been used purely as a window into the parts of the blockchain, space complexity will be linear 0(n) growing proportionally to inout
